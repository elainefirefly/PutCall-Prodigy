## The Problem
Educational option trading platforms are often to complex for newcomers to understand. We saw an opportunity to introduce our users to a simplified educational platform where they will not be intimidated by the introduction of complex topics

## Simplification

To simplify the educational presentation, we limited the amount of underlying assets in our options contracts, eliminated portfolio building and did not include option premiums for ease of understanding.

## Gamification

To gamify options trading we reduced the time intervals of options contracts to be under 1 hour to provide instintaneous feedback
